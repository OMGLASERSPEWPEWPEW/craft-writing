A - Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.

R - For Lucy had her work cut out for her. The doors would be taken off their hinges; Rumpelmayer's men were coming. And then, thought Clarissa Dalloway, what a morning--fresh as if issued to children on a beach. 

R - What a lark! What a plunge! For so it had always seemed to her, when, with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now, she had burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into the open air. How fresh, how calm, stiller than this of course, the air was in the early morning; like the flap of a wave; the kiss of a wave; chill and sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen as she then was) solemn, feeling as she did, standing there at the open window, that something awful was about to happen; looking at the flowers, at the trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks rising, falling; standing and looking until Peter Walsh said, “Musing among the vegetables?”—was that it?—“I prefer men to cauliflowers”—was that it? He must have said it at breakfast one morning when she had gone out on to the terrace—Peter Walsh. He would be back from India one of these days, June or July, she forgot which, for his letters were awfully dull; it was his sayings one remembered; his eyes, his pocket-knife, his smile, his grumpiness and, when millions of things had utterly vanished—how. strange it was!—a few sayings like this about cabbages. 

The Dynamic Flow:
Action: She takes charge.
Reflection: She justifies it (Lucy is busy).
Emotion: She feels the exhilaration and dread and joy of doing it (What a lark!).


A / R - She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall’s van to pass. A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (know-ing her as one does know people who live next door to one in Westminster); a touch of the bird about her, of the jay, bluegreen, light, vivacious, though she was over fifty, and grown very white since her illness.  There she perched, never seeing him, waiting to cross, very upright. 

1. Action (The External View)
Text: She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall’s van to pass.
Your Read: A
Why: This is the physical anchor. It is the objective reality of the scene.
2. Reflection (The Observer's Logic)
Text: A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her... a touch of the bird about her...
Your Read: R
Why: This is indeed a Reflection, but as you noted, the source of the reflection has shifted. We are no longer processing Clarissa’s thoughts on the morning; we are processing Scrope Purvis’s thoughts on Clarissa.

3. The "Omniscient" Feel
Text: There she perched, never seeing him, waiting to cross, very upright.
This confirms your feeling of it being "different." The text mentions that beats cover "one topic, one emotion, or one action" at a time to help the audience follow along.


Here, the "Topic" has changed from Clarissa's Internal World to Clarissa's Public Image.
Previous Paragraph (Emotion): She feels young, alive, plunging ("What a lark!").
This Paragraph (Reflection): She looks like a bird, stiff, elderly, and white-haired ("over fifty, and grown very white").


E - 

	R -For having lived in Westminster--how many years now? over twenty,--one feels even in the midst of the traffic, or waking at night, Clarissa was positive, a particular hush, or solemnity; an indescribable pause; a suspense (but that might be her heart, affected, they said, by influenza) before Big Ben strikes. 

		Analysis: This is Reflection. Clarissa is internalizing her environment. It establishes the "mood" and the internal state of the character. It also introduces a "ticking clock" element (waiting for the hour to strike), creating a moment of suspense.

	A- There! Out it boomed. First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable.  The leaden circles dissolved in the air. 

		Analysis: This is the Action. The environment "interrupts" her thoughts. The striking of Big Ben is a "main event" in this micro-scene, marking a transition in time.

	R - Such fools we are, she thought, crossing Victoria Street. 

		Analysis: She returns to Reflection, but now it is deeper. She is analyzing the human condition. This reveals "who the character is" —someone who values the sensation of living over the logic of it.

	E - For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so, making it up, building it round one, tumbling it, creating it every moment afresh; but the veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries sitting on doorsteps (drink their downfall) do the same; can’t be dealt with, she felt positive, by Acts of Parliament for that very reason: they love life. In people’s eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge; in the bellow. and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June.

		Analysis: This is the Emotion you identified. It is the crescendo. The "tactics" of the sensory details (swing, tramp, trudge, bellows) bombard her to produce this feeling.

R - For it was the middle of June. The War was over, except for some one like Mrs. Foxcroft at the Embassy last night eating her heart out because that nice boy was killed and now the old Manor House must go to a cousin; or Lady Bexorough who opened a bazaar, they said, with the telegram in her hand, John, her favorite, killed; but it was over; thank Heaven—over. It was June. The King and Queen were at the Palace. 

	R - Reflection
		For it was the middle of June. The War was over...
 		Function: This section creates Thematic Depth and establishing Context. It contrasts the relief of the war ending with the specific, lingering grief of Mrs. Foxcroft and Lady Bexborough.  
 		Analysis: This is a perfect example of backstory being revealed naturally rather than via an "info-dump". The reflection grounds us in the specific moment in history (post-WWI) and the character’s awareness of the fragility of life.


A- And every-where, though it was still so early, there was a beating, a strirring of galloping ponies, tapping of cricket bats; Lords, Ascot, Ranelagh and all the rest of it; wrapped in the soft mesh of the grey-blue morning air, which, as the day wore on, would unwind them, and set down on their lawns and pitches the bouncing ponies, whose forefeet just struck the ground and up they sprung, the whirling young men, and laughing girls in their transparent muslins who, even now, after dancing all night, were taking their absurd woolly dogs for a run; and even now, at this hour, discreet old dowagers were shooting out in their motor cars on errands of mystery; and shopkeepers were fidgeting in their windows with their paste and diamonds, their lovely old sea-green brooches in eighteenth-century settings to tempt Americans (but one must economise, not buy things rashly for Elizabeth), 

	A - Action (External Observation)
		And every-where... there was a beating, a stirring...
 		Function: As you identified, this is Action, but specifically it acts as Worldbuilding. It uses "specific, concrete language" (sea-green brooches, transparent muslins) to make the setting feel "lived-in".    
Analysis: The "Action" here is the movement of the city rather than the character herself. It provides the Pacing and energy that pulls Clarissa out of her somber reflection. The mention of "shopkeepers... fidgeting" helps visualize the environment clearly. 



E - and she, too, loving it as she did with an absurd and faithful passion, being part of it, since her people were courtiers once in the time of the Georges, she, too, was going that very night to kindle and illuminate; to give her party.  

	E - Emotion
		...she, too, loving it as she did with an absurd and faithful passion...
 		Function: This beat identifies her Motivation and Goal.  
		Analysis:
		The Desire: Her "absurd and faithful passion" for life drives her.
		The Goal: "To give her party." In the context of the source text, characters need goals to drive them through the story. The party is her way of connecting, of "kindling and illuminating." 
		The Conflict: There is a tiny micro-conflict here: "tempt Americans (but one must economise...)." This shows a fleeting Character vs. Self conflict regarding money versus her desire to participate in the beauty around her. 




A - But how strange, on entering the Park, the silence; the mist; the hum; the slow-swimming happy ducks; the pouched birds waddling; and who should be coming along with his back against the Government buildings, most appropriately, carrying a despatch box stamped with the Royal Arms, who but Hugh Whitbread; her old friend Hugh—the admirable Hugh! 

	A - Action (Scene Initiation)
		But how strange, on entering the Park... who but Hugh Whitbread...
 		Function: This shifts from general observation to a specific Scene with other characters.  
		Analysis:
 		Spatial Coherence: We clearly track her movement "entering the Park".  
		The Encounter: The arrival of Hugh Whitbread suggests the beginning of a dialogue scene. According to your text, characters in scenes with others usually have agendas.   		Expectation: The phrasing "most appropriately" and "admirable Hugh" suggests she has positive expectations, though the "tactics" Hugh uses in the upcoming dialogue will determine if the scene is a win, lose, or draw.
