Things that Affect Telling

Narrative Distance

The narrative distance is you yardstick for show, don’t tell (SDT). It can help determine how detached you can be without falling into told prose. 

Example:

Close Narrative Distance: The zombie lunged through the open window. Oh, crap! Bob grabbed the shotgun and pulled the trigger. 

Far Narrative Distance: As the zombie came through the window, Bob reached for the shotgun.  Oh, crap! he thought before pulling the trigger. 

In the close narrative distance example, you see the action as it unfolds—the zombie lunges through the window. Next, you hear the POV’s thought (his response to the action)—“Oh, crap!” Finally, POV processes and acts—he grabs the shotgun and shoots the zombie.

In the far narrative distance example, you see less of what’s happening, even though it feels like you saw more. You don’t see the zombie lunge through the window; the narrator explains that it came through the window.  Bob reaches for the shotgun, but now it feels like more of a passive reaction to the zombie than an active response. “As the zombie did this, Bob did that.” You’re told his thought (the “he thought” is a dead giveaway here). and there’s a mention that he pulled the trigger. “He thought this before he did that.” Again, it’s a description of action, not actual action, so it feels less immediate.  It’s the equivalent of, “He said angrily,” versus. “He yelled and slammed the door.”  Both get the information across, but one feels more in the moment and shown. 

Example 2:

As the zombie came through the window, Bob reached for the shotgun so he could blow its head off.  He thought, Oh, crap! right before he pulled the trigger. 

Hear the difference? This sounds like someone describing the scene, not someone in the scene. You’re told the zombie came through the window, but you don’t see the action.  You’re told Bob reached for the shotgun and why, but you never see the shotgun go off.  You’re told he thinks, “Oh, crap!,” and that he pulls the trigger, but it’s all described in relation to what else is going on. 

Example 3:

Bob was around thirty, but he felt older from constantly running from zombies. He left the rundown hotel room he and his wife Sally had been staying in and lofted a pair of worn duffel bags into the back of an old pickup truck. He sighed and stared at what was left of their supplies. I wish I had a few more boxes of ammunition, he thought. They were headed to Armarillo, which he knew was overrun with the undead, and he didn’t want to be caught unprepared.  Sally had begged him to take another route since it was so dangerous, but the distress call they’d picked up last week had come from an Amarillo radio station.  Bob also knew you didn’t ignore other survivors. 

Look at the phrases that feel told:

“Bob was around thirty, but he felt older from constantly running from zombies.”
Tells you why Bob feels older than thirty.  You see no details or examples that suggest or show how he feels about his age.

“he and his wife Sally had been staying in” explains why they’re at the hotel.  On its own it’s not bad, but it only adds to the told feel when combined with the other text. 

“an old pickup truck” pulls the point of view away and suggests he doesn’t own the pickup. Minor to be sure, but what’s known and what’s not know are key to being in a point-of-view character’s head. 

“what was left of their supplies” explains they don’t have much left. 

“I wish I had a few more boxes of ammunition, he thought” tells you what he’s thinking.  Again, on its own it’s a perfectly acceptable way to show a thought, but mixed in with all the other explanations, it adds to the told feeling. 

“They were headed to Armarillo, which he knew” is a double whammy. It’s telling you where they’re going, and that he knows something, which would be obvious if this were written in his point of view.

“didn’t want to be caught” tells motives again. It explains what the problem is and how Bob feels about it. 

“since it was so dangerous” also tells why Sally feels the way she does, as well as tells readers where they’re going is dangerous.

“Bob also knew” tells you again what Bob knows instead of relaying the information in a way he’d think it.

Now, let’s take this same paragraph and rewrite it with a far narrative distance (such as, a third-person omniscient):

The man was around thirty, but looked older, worn out from the constant running, the constant fear. He left the rundown hotel room and lofted a pair of equally worn duffel bags into the back of an old pickup truck. He sighed, staring at the meager supplies as if he wished he had a few more boxes of ammunition. Amarillo was overrun with the undead, and no place to be caught unprepared. His wife had begged him to take another route, but the distress call they’d picked up last week had come from an Amarillo radio station.  Every survivor knew you didn’t ignore other survivors.  Bob was no exception. 


Clearly Bob isn’t our narrator here. Someone else is watching this scene unfold and describing it. The word choice, the rhythm, the voice, aren’t Bob’s but another person’s—an omniscient narrator—but the focus is still on Bob. Even though Bob isn’t telling the story, it’s following his story. The narrator might be distant (and the narrative distance far), but there’s judgement in the words used. The voice of the narrator shines through and makes it feel as though a person was behind the words. 




Now, let’s make Bob the POV and go for 3p-lim. The focus is on Bob and sharing what he knows, feels, and sees, but the narrator is someone watching through him. 

Bob was around thirty, but felt older, worn out from the constant running, the constant fear. He left the rundown hotel room and lofted a pair of old duffel bags into the back of his even older pickup truck.  He sighed, staring at the meager supplies and wishing he had a few more boxes of ammunition. Amarillo was overrun with the undead, and no place to be caught unprepared.  Sally had begged him to take another route, but the distress call they’d picked up last week had come from an Amarillo radio station.  Everyone knew you didn’t ignore other survivors.  

This time, you see out of Bob’s eyes, hear his thoughts, but despite how tight the narrative distance is, it’s not him replaying this information.  It’s someone else who knows Bob well enough to know how he feels about what’s around him and what’s important to him.  Everything is now filtered through Bob’s perspective. 

He “felt older” is how Bob feels.  He doesn’t feel thirty.

“old duffel bags” implies Bob knows the age of the bags, versus “equally worn” of a more distant narrator who only guesses what they can see.

“his even older pickup truck” implies Bob owns the truck and has had it longer than the bags.  Note the use of “an older truck” in the omniscient narrator versus “his older truck” in Bob’s POV. Bob knows it’s “his” truck, not “a” truck.

“and wishing” shows Bob is indeed wishing for something.

“Sally had begged” is again person and known information to Bob instead of the distant “his wife” of the first example.  He refers to her as he normally does, with no need to explain their relationship. 

“Everyone knew” is now something Bob knows, not just random information.  The narrator is showing all the things Bob knows and how he’d see them, but we’re not deep inside his head.  There’s still a little distance between Bob and the reader. 

You can see how minor these word changes affect how the passage sounds. Where you position the narrator affects how detached or close the POV feels, which determines whether details are seen through the character’s eyes or seen from outside the character. A simple edit from “a truck” to “the truck” or “his truck” alters the POV and even voice—and changes how told or shown this paragraph feels. 

Filtering the POV:

Filtering is one way writers control the narrative distance.  How much of the POV’s experience is filtered can make the prose feel personal or detached.  Using a large number of filter words can turn a shown scene into a told scene in no time at all. 

Filter words are words that distance readers from POV and you often find them in prose using far narrative distance.  These words can make the text feel detached.  Filter words also remind readers they’re reading, explain things that are obvious, and often lead a writer into telling or crafting passive sentences. 

Filter words include: saw, heard, felt, knew, watched, decided, noticed, realized, wondered, thought, looked. 

The more filter words used, the higher the likelihood of the prose sounding told. 

A POV by definition is relaying everything she sees, hears, touches, smells, thinks—she’s already filtering for you; it’s just a matter of how obvious the filter is.  If a tree is described, readers know she saw a tree.  Saying, “She looked at the tree” and then describing it is redundant at best, clunky and telling at worst. 

Examples:

Bob could see three zombies shambling toward him.
Sally knew she had to get out of there.
I could feel the hard metal of the knife against my back.
Jane heard a scream from the hotel bathroom. 

Each of these examples has a filter word in it, explaining what should be obvious by the rest of the text.

Look at them without filter words:

Three zombies shambled toward Bob.
Sally had to get out of there.  Or better: She had to get out of there. (Using the pronoun makes it more personal, and more like an internal thought)
Hard metal pressed against my back.
A scream echoed from the hotel bathroom.

Nothing is lost. They have a greater sense of immediacy. 

More examples, wondered, realized, decided, noticed, type. 

Bob realized he’d have to make a run for it.
Jane wondered if they’d make it out of there alive.
Sally decided they’d just have to jump and see what happened. 
I noticed the car was missing. 

These summarize the thinking and decision-making processes. You don’t get to see Bob realize running is his only option; you’re told he does.  The author tells you what Jane is wondering; you don’t get to see her wonder in her own voice with her own concerns.  Sally’s decision reads more like an afterthought than someone making a hard choice. If you suddenly noticed your car was missing, your reaction is probably going to be stronger than realizing you “noticed something.” The importance in this example is on the noticing, not the missing car. 

Eliminate the filter words and you get:

He’d have to make a run for it.
Would they make it out of there alive?
They’d just have to jump and see what happened.
Wait—where was her car?

Without the filter words, the focus is on what is thought and decided. 

However, sometimes you want that filter word if it’s important to draw attention to the act (the feeling, hearing, watching, realizing), or it sounds more dramatic with that filter—this works well for chapter or scene enders.  You might also want more filters if you’re doing a far narrative distance or an omniscient narrator and want to create a detached, observer tone. 

Bob watched the perimeter, eyes and ears alert for zombies. 
Jane closed her eyes and wondered if any of them would survive until dawn.
I hoped for the best. Once in a while it worked out, right?
