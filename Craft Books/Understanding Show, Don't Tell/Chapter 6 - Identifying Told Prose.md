Identifying Told Prose

Show, don’t tell is a broad concept, which is why one rule doesn’t cover it all.  It’s subjective, and each telling instance found in your writing must be evaluated in context.  Does this sentence sound told? Is this scene explaining too much? But if you look at only the text, you risk missing told prose in your writing, since a sentence that technically shows can feel told. It’s important to examine the different levels of telling so you know what to look for. 

You’ll find told prose at:

The sentence level
The paragraph level
The scene level

Telling at the Sentence Level

You’ll find most told prose at the sentence level.  Most can be caught by searching for the red flag words. 

Tells that explain: explaining reasons why characters feel or act as they do. They also sneak in when you fear the text isn’t clear enough and you have to explain information so readers “Get it.”

Tells that summarize: Summarizing instead of dramatizing.  They often read as though someone is watching the scene unfold from the sidelines, giving a general overview of the action.  They might even sound like a summary you’d find in an outline instead of a novel. 

Tells That Convey Information. 

Many tells exist only to convey information the characters would never think (or have reason) to  share, such as world-building details or character backstories. They often sound too self-aware, or read as if the author was jumping into the story with a mini-lecture. 

It’s helpful to consider what the tell is trying to accomplish when revising it. 

Categories of tells include: 

Motivational tells: 
Motivational tells explain the personal motivations of the characters. They’re the reasons the characters are acting either from a personal need, or in reaction to what else is going on in the scene. Explaining motives pushes the narrator away from the point-of-view character’s head and describes the action and events from the outside as an observer, not from the inside as a participant.  Red flag words include to, when, and because.

Emotional Tells: Emotional tells explain feelings instead of letting observable details suggest the emotion. Often, they explain that a character has an emotion, but offer no details or clues that allow readers to feel those emotions as well. They keep the emotions external, preventing any empathy from, or emotional connection with, readers. Red flag words include in [ emotion ], with [emotion], and felt.

Mental tells:

Mental tells explain that the character is thinking something, but doesn’t show the actual thought. These are much more common in medium to far narrative distances and omniscient points of view. For example, a distant narrator might use “she hoped” where a close narrator wouldn’t. Context and author intent play a strong role in deciding if these words are causing trouble in your writing. Red flag words include realized, hoped, and wondered.

Stage Direction Tells: 
Stage direction tells explain the order of events as if the narrator knows what happened before it happened. They throw off the natural stimulus/response structure and cause readers to pause to figure out what chronology events happened in before they can continue reading. They can also summarize a decision that readers never get to see the point-of-view character make. Red flag words include as, by, since, after, when, and before. 

Descriptive Tells:
Descriptive tells explain sense of actions (looking, hearing, smelling, feeling), and often signal that something is about to be described. They explain what readers should be able to figure out by observing the characters as they move about the story. Filter words are the primary red flag flag words here: saw, watched, heard, smelled, felt, could see, could hear, could feel, the sound of, seemed, appeared, looked. 

Passive Tells: Passive tells explain sense actions (looking, hearing, smelling, feeling), and often signal that something is about to be described.  They explain what readers should be able to figure out by observing the characters as they move about the story.  Filter words are the primary red flag words here: saw, watched, heard, smelled, felt, could see, could hear, could hear, could feel, could smell, the sound of, seemed, appeared, looked.
