Identifying Told Prose

Show, don’t tell is a broad concept, which is why one rule doesn’t cover it all.  It’s subjective, and each telling instance found in your writing must be evaluated in context.  Does this sentence sound told? Is this scene explaining too much? But if you look at only the text, you risk missing told prose in your writing, since a sentence that technically shows can feel told. It’s important to examine the different levels of telling so you know what to look for. 

You’ll find told prose at:

The sentence level
The paragraph level
The scene level

Telling at the Sentence Level

You’ll find most told prose at the sentence level.  Most can be caught by searching for the red flag words. 

Tells that explain: explaining reasons why characters feel or act as they do. They also sneak in when you fear the text isn’t clear enough and you have to explain information so readers “Get it.”

Tells that summarize: Summarizing instead of dramatizing.  They often read as though someone is watching the scene unfold from the sidelines, giving a general overview of the action.  They might even sound like a summary you’d find in an outline instead of a novel. 

Tells That Convey Information. 

Many tells exist only to convey information the characters would never think (or have reason) to  share, such as world-building details or character backstories. They often sound too self-aware, or read as if the author was jumping into the story with a mini-lecture. 

It’s helpful to consider what the tell is trying to accomplish when revising it. 

Categories of tells include: 

Motivational tells: 
Motivational tells explain the personal motivations of the characters. They’re the reasons the characters are acting either from a personal need, or in reaction to what else is going on in the scene. Explaining motives pushes the narrator away from the point-of-view character’s head and describes the action and events from the outside as an observer, not from the inside as a participant.  Red flag words include to, when, and because.

Emotional Tells: Emotional tells explain feelings instead of letting observable details suggest the emotion. Often, they explain that a character has an emotion, but offer no details or clues that allow readers to feel those emotions as well. They keep the emotions external, preventing any empathy from, or emotional connection with, readers. Red flag words include in [ emotion ], with [emotion], and felt.




Mental tells: Mental tells explain that the character is thinking something, but doesn’t show the actual thought. These are much more common in medium to far narrative distances and omniscient points of view. For example, a distant narrator might use “she hoped” where a close narrator wouldn’t. Context and author intent play a strong role in deciding if these words are causing trouble in your writing. Red flag words include realized, hoped, and wondered.

Stage Direction Tells: 
Stage direction tells explain the order of events as if the narrator knows what happened before it happened. They throw off the natural stimulus/response structure and cause readers to pause to figure out what chronology events happened in before they can continue reading. They can also summarize a decision that readers never get to see the point-of-view character make. Red flag words include as, by, since, after, when, and before. 

Descriptive Tells:
Descriptive tells explain sense of actions (looking, hearing, smelling, feeling), and often signal that something is about to be described. They explain what readers should be able to figure out by observing the characters as they move about the story. Filter words are the primary red flag flag words here: saw, watched, heard, smelled, felt, could see, could hear, could feel, the sound of, seemed, appeared, looked. 

Passive Tells: Passive tells are found in passive sentences where the subject of the sentence is being acted upon, not doing the acting.  Most often these result from passive “to be” verbs, which create that passive voice and make the sentence feel told. Red flag words include selected “to be” verbs, such as was [verb] and is being [verb], and by.

Let’s look at examples of each of these:

Motivational Tell: Jane darted into the hall because she was afraid Sally might see her.

Emotional Tell: Her heart filled with sadness.

Mental Tell: Bob realized he’d never be able to convince Sally to take another route.

Stage Direction Tell: Before Sally could reach the hotel door, six zombies burst out of the woods. 

Descriptive Tell: Jane could see the scratches along the edge of the doorframe. 

Passive Tell: Bob was smacked in the head by Sally as he played with the chopsticks. 

In all these examples, deleting or revising the red flag word will eliminate the telling.  For some, the rest of the sentence won’t change much, but for others, turning the tell into a show will require reworking the entire sentence, possibly turning it into a paragraph. Showing often takes more words than telling, because you have to provide enough clues for readers to understand the motives and actions of the characters by what they observe in the scene. 

For example, let’s analyze the motivational tell:

Jane darted into the hall because she was afraid Sally might see her. 


The told portion of this sentence is “because she was afraid Sally might see her.”  If you cut that, the sentence shows.  However, if you just write, “Jane darted into the hall,” there might not be enough information for readers to understand why Jane darts into the hall. 

Ex.

Jane darted into the hall and pressed up against the wall.  Had Sally seen her?

Sally’s voice echoed ahead.  Jane froze.  Yikes, her again. She darted into the hall and pressed up against the wall. 

Jane darted into the hall and pressed up against the wall.  Please don’t see me, please don’t see me.

Revising the rest:

Emotional Tell: Her heart filled with sadness.
Emotional Show: Her chest tightened, holding back her sobs.

Mental Tell: Bob realized he’d never be able to convince Sally to take another route.
Mental Show: No way he’d convince Sally to take another route.

Stage Direction Tell: Before Sally could reach the hotel door, six zombies burst out of the woods.
Stage Direction Show: Something rustled in the trees and Sally picked up her pace. She licked her lips.  Only ten feet from the hotel room.  She could. make that, right? Branches cracked and six zombies burst from the treeline.  She swore. Maybe not. 

Descriptive Tell: Jane could see the scratches along the edge of the doorframe. 
Descriptive Show: Deep gouges marred the doorframe. 

Passive Tell: Bob was smacked in the head by Sally as he played with the chopsticks.
Passive Show: Bob stuck the chopsticks under his lips and barked like a walrus.  Sally groaned and smacked him in the head. Now was not the time for his dumb jokes. 




Telling at the Paragraph Level


If told prose is explaining or summarizing a situation, the telling can affect an entire paragraph or even a page. You’ll find these tells most often when you pull away from the point-of-view character and start describing what’s going on from afar.

You’ll find typical red flag words at this level, plus:

Infodump tells: The difference between these tells and other red flag word tells is that infodumps focus almost exclusively on information relating to the world.  It’s information readers “need” to understand that particular story. Red flag words include because and since.

Backstory tells: Backstory tells focus exclusively on the histories of the characters, explaining why characters are the way they are.  Red flag words include remember, knew, and when.


The difference between backstory and infodump: 

Infodump: worldbuilding
Backstory: why a character is why they is

Ex.

Bob screamed in pain when the zombies clawed his leg. He struggled to get away, and realized he had seconds to shake loose before the thing got its hooks into him and went straight for his brain. Zombies needed brains to survive or they turned to dust and bones in just under thirty days. He didn’t have thirty seconds let alone thirty days.


Note: You don’t see the zombie claw Bob; you’re told the reason he screams and how he screams…in pain. When the zombie clawed his leg.  Even worse, the word “when” puts the cause of the scream after you hear, so the stimulus comes after the response. Bob screams because the zombie clawed his leg.  The told prose has him screaming before readers learn the reason. Not only are readers pushed away from the action, they have to take a second to figure out the right chronology of the events. The problem with having a zombie on your leg is stated flat out. 

Ex.

The zombie clawed Bob’s leg. He screamed. He struggled , but he had seconds to shake loose before the thing got its hooks into him and went straight for his brain.

This shows but its just as boring.  Getting rid of red flag words isn’t enough to turn this paragraph from told to shown in a way readers would care about.  

Now let’s put some details in there and show the action: 

Ex.

The zombie tore through his pants, sinking its broken fingernails deep into his calf.  Fire and knives raced up his leg and Bob screamed.  He kicked at it with his free foot, but it held tight.

“Let go, you sonuva—“

He kept kicking, but each heartbeat brought it—and its infected teeth—closer. Sure, maybe he wasn’t using his brain this instant, but he wasn’t about to let this dragger get it. Or him. 


Spotting Told Infodumps

Pausing the story to explain a large chunk of information is the definition of infodump, so it’s logical that you often find told prose in them. 

Told infodumps shove in information; shown infodumps sneak it in so it reads like the character is using that information to make decisions in that moment—and that’s good. 

For example, if you’re trying to convey that being out on the streets after dark is dangerous, you’d show the character acting nervous about going out after dark, or have him think about it being a bad idea.  You’d want to avoid a paragraph-long infodump about the reason it’s dangerous to be out after dark and why that reason exists.


Infodump paragraph ex.

Mardel frowned. Leaving Lord Jull’s house was a bad idea, even if getting caught meant his death. Ever since the dark wizard’s guild opened that portal to who-knew-where, the streets of Klanduk were crawling with demons who devoured souls of all they encountered.  Those with any sense at all stayed in when the sun went down, but he didn’t have a choice. He slipped out the door and into the night, and hoped he’d stay clear of demons. 

This explains why being outside is bad, which does little to pique curiosity about what’s to come.  Since the story stopped so clearly to dump this information on the readers, they can assume Mardel will indeed run into a demon. That takes most of the fun out of it, because they’ll be waiting for it to happen instead of wondering what problems he’ll face after dark. And because it says demons eat souls, they’ll know this won’t actually happen to Mardel (the stake is too high—death), so the tension vanishes and there’s nothing to anticipate. Later in the scene when he runs into a demon, readers will have seen it coming from a mile away. 

Let’s analyze this further:

“Mardel frowned” is a solid shown line as this is what Mardel does. 

“Leaving Lord Jull’s house was a bad idea, even if getting caught meant his death” is something that could easily be his internal thought, but it could also feel detached and told if surrounded by other told prose (which it does).

“Ever since the dark wizard’s guild opened that portal to who-knew-where, the streets of Klanduk were crawling with demons who devoured the souls of all they encountered”

is classic infodumping. Mardel knows this information, so there’s no reason to think about it except to tell readers why it’s dangerous to go out after dark. 

“Those with any sense at all stayed in when the sun went down, but he didn’t have a choice.” could be Mardel’s thoughts, or an explanation.  It depends on what the narrative distance is. 

“He slipped out the door and into the night, and hoped he’d stay clear of demons” tips a bit into told prose, because he “hoped he’d stay clear of demons” feels a little too on-the-nose for a natural internal thought.  However, if it were the only told line in the paragraph, it would probably slide right by and not stand out.  But with the other told bits, it sounds more told than shown. 


Ex. paragraph without the infodump sentence:

Mardel frowned.  Leaving Lord Jull’s house was a bad idea, even if getting caught meant his death.  Those with any sense at all stayed in when the sun went down, but he didn’t have a choice. He slipped out the door and into the night, and hoped he’d stay clear of demons. 

Flat but serviceable.  But without the told sentence, the rest of these lines don’t stand up as well all by their lonesome. It vaguely hints that being out after dark is bad, but doesn’t provide enough details to make readers worry at all, or give a sense of what those dangers are.  That might make you think the told line was working, but in reality, the paragraph doesn’t convey much information in either example, nor does it create any interesting story questions to draw readers in. 

This time, let’s get inside Mardel’s head:

Mardel frowned.  Leaving Lord Jull’s house was a bad idea, but he had little chice. He faced certain capture and death if he stayed, but to risk the dark streets alone, without decent weapons? He shuddered.  Still, possible death—even soul death—was better than Lord Jull finding him here. He slipped out the door and into the night. 

Dilemma Mardel faces is much clearer now and more interesting. Readers can see he can’t stay there or he’ll be captured and killed, but going out is equally dangerous.  What might happen on those streets becomes a tease.  Readers will wonder, “Why is being out after dark dangerous.”  What might happen becomes a tease. Plenty to intrigue them to read on. Can anticipate without having mystery explained. No mentions of demons will make the appearance of one more surprising. 

Telling at the Scene Level

 



 Spotting told backstory:

Ex.

Mardel approached the house he hadn’t seen in ten years, not since the night Jull tried to kill him and almost succeeded. [Imagine the scene goes into a two-page flashback that describes how this event happened.] Never again, he thought.  The scar along his thigh burned from where Jull’s blade had cut him, barely missing his gut.  He must be more desperate than he thought to come back here. 

Explaining what happened between Mardel and Jull steals mystery from scene.  Readers won’t wonder about the scar, or why Mardel hasn’t been back in ten years.  The flashback tells the backstory and explains away every reason they have to keep reading. Even the text leading up to it contains told prose, with, “not since the night Jull tried to kill him.”

Backstory and flashbacks are two of the rare places where showing instead of telling saves you words. 

Ex. w/o flashback and backstory

Mardel approached the house he’d avoided for ten years. The scar along his thigh burned and he scowled. He must be more desperate than he’d thought.

Anticipation is what keeps readers reading. If answers are revealed before Mardel goes into the house, anything learned in the house will feel redundant.
