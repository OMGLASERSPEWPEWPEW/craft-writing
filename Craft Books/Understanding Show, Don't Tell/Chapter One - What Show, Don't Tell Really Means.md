What Show, Don’t Tell Really Means

Basic example 1:

I reached over to pick up the cup. 

The first part, “I reached over,” is a physical and demonstrable action. You can physically reach over. “To pick up” is an explanation of why that person reached over.  There is no actual picking up of the cup, just the stated intention to do so, and you can’t show intention.  However, you can show the observable results of intention.  Change one tiny word and suddenly this same sentence shows instead of tells.

I reached over and picked up the cup. 

Both are physical and demonstrable actions.  Both can be observed. You can reach over, and you can pick up a cup. 

Now, apply POV:

What’s considered told prose can be deepened by considering POV. Since this is 1p, the character knows exactly why she’s reaching over, so her saying “to pick up the cup” is accurate. She knows why she’s reaching.  Her explaining her motivation for reaching doesn’t feel out of place, so even though it tells, it’s not something that will jar a reader out of the story or feel awkward—which is why nobody gets all that upset about this type of tell. 

Let’s take that same sentence and put it in a tight 3p.  Say Sally is the point-of-view character and she’s watching Jane:

Jane reached over to pick up the cup.

Now the POV is assigning motive to the reaching before the cup is even picked up.  In this case, “to pick up the cup” is something Sally would not know until Jane does it.  She’s explaining why Jane is reaching and there’s no guarantee she knows why. 

Basic example 2: 

adverb

One trick to test if you’re showing or telling is to imagine yourself acting out whatever it is your characters are doing.  If you can do what they do, you’re showing.  If not, you’re telling.

“I hate you,” I said angrily.

You can stand in the room and say, “I hate you,” out loud, but try to act out “angrily.”  You can’t, not really. Angrily is an adverb, which is a word used to modify a verb (the action) and in essence describe or show how an action is performed—it’s not action in and of itself. That’s the subtle difference in showing versus telling. You can act out behavior that demonstrates “angrily,” but there’s nothing about the adverb itself that you can physically do.  The only way to show it is to do something else. 

“I hate you,” I yelled, kicking the door closed. 

You can yell and you can kick the door closed. Both show anger and anyone watching you would be able to figure out your mood by observing your actions.  We don’t typically think in adverbs, which is why they tend to stand out. 

I walked slowly across the room. 

“Slowly” has a physical connotation in our minds, so even though it’s an adverb, it conveys a real action.  We can imagine what walking slowly looks like.  But look closer—when you “walk slowly across the room,” exactly what do you do? Tiptoe? Slink? Take exaggeratedly slow steps? Even though you can “walk slowly” and be understood by your readers, the actual action can be any number of walking styles. 

S-&-T w/ internalization:

She sighed, realizing she’d left her phone on her desk. 

Sighing you can do, but act out someone realizing.  Again, you can’t.  You’re telling readers that the person is realizing she forgot her phone.  The line “realizing she’d left her phone on her desk” is explaining the reason that she sighed.  

She sighed. Darn. Her phone was on her desk, right next to the stupid report she also forgot to grab.

You can sigh, you can think, “Darn,” and you can also think the internalization that comes after.  This is a realistic progression of action and thoughts for someone realizing she left her phone at the office.
