The Problems With Telling.

What a reader considers good writing also varies.  Readers of literary fiction might want as many adjectives and word pictures as they can get, enjoying the wordplay and use of language. Readers of thrillers might prefer a little explanation (telling) to keep the pace moving quickly, while romance readers want the focus on the emotions and how everyone feels more than dramatizing the action. 

Example 1:

Monique dashed along the riverbank, sending flowers dancing into the air, only to land softly on the gentle waves before sinking below the surface.

Monique raced along the river bank, seconds ahead of the killer.

Monique ran along the riverbank, Philippe’s warm hand in hers, soft as the flowers beneath their feet. 


Example 2: 

	John was angry about getting fired. He yelled at his wife, his kids, even the neighbors. None of his friends wanted to talk to him, and it had gotten so bad they pretended not to see him, and it had gotten so bad they pretended not to see him when they ran into him at the grocery store. Naturally, this pissed him off even more, and it was the poor dog that suffered his wrath. 

Some people will say this paragraph is shown, others will say it’s told—and they’re both right.

	John slammed the door behind him. Who did that stuffed shirt think he was anyway? Fire him? That cesspool of an office would wither and die without him.
	“You’re home early,”
	“Am I interrupting your bon-bon eating or something?”
	Her smile faded. “What’s wrong?”
	“I don’t get any damn respect, that’s what’s wrong.”

 
Example 3:

	When she couldn’t stand it anymore, she slapped him.

	Kim ran from the room because she didn’t want to see him with another woman. 

	She screamed in pain as the knife sliced her hand. 

All of these explain, but it wouldn’t take much to show enough details for readers to understand what’s happening. 

	Stop it. Stop it stop it stop it.  She trembled, the words a mantra holding back her fury. “Enough!” she screamed, slapping him. 

	He stood by the fountain, smiling at the woman who’d replaced her in his life. Kim frowned and turned around. No way was she walking in there. 

	The knife sliced through her hand and she screamed. 

Not only does explaining risk telling, it frequently kills the tension of the scene because you’re not leaving anything for readers to figure out on their own.  Rare is the person who will watch a sporting event after hearing the final score.
