Sometimes telling is better:

When showing will detract from unfolding events in a scene. 
When showing will bog down the story or bore the reader, such as relaying every punch or kick thrown in a lengthy fight. 

Ex.

Say Bob has just been scouting and found a huge nest of zombies acting very un-zombielike. Readers have read the scene, and now Bob is back with his group and needs to let them know what he saw. 

Dramatizing it will bore your reader, so a quick telling summary works better to keep the story moving. 

“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Bob said, tossing back half his Scotch. He told them about the nest down by the river, the freakish way the zombies had moved, and the almost organized way they’d worked together. His hands were shaking by the end.
“Wow,” Jane whispered. 
He nodded. “Yeah. Wow.”

Telling for Dramatic Impact
Sometimes it’s also better to tell when you want to add narrative distance for dramatic effect, such as pulling away from the point-of-view character to convey that “dum dum dum!” sense of impending doom. This happens most often with the words wondered, hoped, and prayed. 

Ex.

She watched him ride away and hoped he’d never come back. 
He wondered if Lila had seen Chuck that night.
They prayed it was the last time. 

Telling to Convey Necessary Information

Sometimes readers need to know certain information and there’s no easy way to do it. Info dumps and backstory are the only way to slip that information into the book.
