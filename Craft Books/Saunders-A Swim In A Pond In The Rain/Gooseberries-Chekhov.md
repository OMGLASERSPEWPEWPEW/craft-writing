the first snow of the year stated to fall softly behind her. 


Gooseberries on surface is not a story that should change a life.  Nothing much happens in it. There’s no big culminating action no active conflict nobodies trajectory gets altered forever, nobody dies or fights or falls in love. 

it’s basically two friends caught in the rain shelter in the home of a third friend. Where one of them tells a story unsatisfying to the others. 

Gooseberries in Outline:

Ivan Ivanych and Burkin out hunting walks across a Russian plane.  Burkin reminds Ivan that Ivan owes him a story. It starts to rain. They head for the home of Alyohin a friend that lives nearby. They meet Alyohin and his maid, Pelageya. The men go to Alyohin’s bath house.  Alyohin blackens the water.  Ivan enjoys a swim, too much according to Burkin. 

Back in the house in a cozy drawing room, Ivan tells the promised story. Ivan’s brother Nikolyav, longing for the country life, lives frugally in order to obtain it. Nikolay marries a widow for her money and kills her with his frugality. He gets his farm. Ivan visits the farm. There that memory brings Ivan to give a speech. 

The happy are an overwhelming force enabled by the silent 

The happy need to be reminded that not everyone is happy.

It is now a torment for Ivan to see happiness.  He urges Burkin and Alyohin to live not for happiness but to live for something greater,  Do not cease to do good. 

Back in the drawing room, Ivan’s story is judged a big drag. 

Bedtime, they go to bed. 

There’s a rain-caused digression as Ivan is about to tell the story and ends about two pages later once he starts to tell it. 

not only is it a digression but it can be popped right out of the story. Watch if we pop it out the result looks like this:

Ivan Ivanych heaves a slow sigh and lights his pipe before beginning his story…2 page cut here… “we are two brothers he began, I ivan ivanych and nikolyav who is my brother. 




Feels natural, it rains so Ivan has to wait until he tells his story. 

an 82 line digression in a story that’s like 342 lines.

We feel the ancedote about the brother to be the heart of the story …but the heart of the heart of the ancedote is his impassioned speech about the nature of happiness. 




it’s a radical speech.

Behind the door of every contented happy man there ought to be someone standing with a little hammer and continually reminding him with a knock that there are unhappy people. That however happy he may be, Life will sooner or later show its claws. and trouble will come to him.

the question of whether our urge to be happy is to be indulged or resisted.


Ivan concludes that there is no happiness or there should be none. 


There’s a small and charming moment when we find out Alyohin and Burkin aren’t moved by Ivan’s speech.

In that setting, warm and well feed drinking tea one felt talk about thinking of other things.  Of course Burkin and Alyohin wouldn’t want to talk about it—they’re examples of what Ivan’s talking about. concerned only with their own pleasure. having stuffed themselves with food someone else cooked. Their reaction proves the point, the contented and happy don’t listen. They don’t want to hear anything that might break their enjoyment.  The white cool beds that have been made by the pretty maid. 

He says one more thing draws the covers over his head and goes to sleep.  

There are two paragraphs left which change everything.  

The first paragraph is the pipe that lays on the table smells strongly of tobacco and Burkin who could not sleep because of the strong odor. So ivan that great moral thinker has done a thoughtless thing with a consequence to his friend. Or more correctly, he can’t sleep because of the agitation caused by ivan’s speech and wide awake notices the cigar stink. 

Ivan’s thoughtlessness complicates our view of him. 

Is ivan’s speech true? Yes or at least it’s not suspect coming from a source thats unable to take its own advice.
