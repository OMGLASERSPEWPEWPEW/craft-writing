“It is ready,” said one of the young women, and after flicking with her apron the top of the samovar which was now boiling over, she carried it with an effort to the table, raised it, and set it down with a thud.

10. Nikita’s postscript

getting lost and coming home ending with the biggest coming home of all: vasili comes home to moral completion and we assume heaven.  

nikita ends with a double coming home of Nikita - home to village and home to god. 

shadow structure: each section starts with a problem or setback, and a dangled hope of improvement.

1. vasili wants  land and its a holiday but goes out to get it. 
2. theyre lost but find town 
3. theyre lost but find way back to town
4. set out again but this time with a guide 
5. they are lost but admit it and resolve to shelter near ravine
6. vasili despairs but takes action by running away to save himself.
7. nikita is dying but accepts it
8. vasili is lost on food but finds sled again
9. vasili is dying but dies happy
10. nikita lives another twenty years but is glad to be going. 

larger arc: vasili botches his life but is saved in the end. 

first goal: leave estate and get lost for the first time

lesser writer: 

1. as they leave home, they pass some things and discuss some random topics.
2. they reach a crossroads, vasili takes straight road, he just takes it
3. nikita falls asleep just because
4. they get lost

tolstoy (increase causality)
1. as they leave home, vasili pokes at nikita by bringing up subject of nikita’s wife.  Then he asks if nikita is going to buy a horse, which suggests something familiar to nikita that vasili is going to try and cheat him. these two discussions leave nikita irritated.
2. they reach a crossroads. vasili asks nikita’s opinion and we feel nikita’s opinion is sensible, then vasili ignores it.  When ignored, nikita doesn’t push back. 
3. nikita falls asleep.  we feel this to be a reaction to 1 and 2… with nikita irritated and ignored he takes himself out of the game. 
4. with nikita asleep, vasili steers by his own and gets them lost. 

those that get published and those that don’t: a willingness to revise, making causality 


causality is hard. story = a series of things that happen in sequence in which we can determine causality




causation is what creates the appearance of meaning. 

the king died and the queen died. <-events unrelated
The king died and the queen died of grief.  <- puts events in relation




scene with the group of drunk peasants in a sled.  how does it advance the story in a meaningful way? 

drunk peasants run into vasili and nikita and try to race.  They whip the horse.   Nikita speaks to Vasili about how bad the peasants are to make the animal suffer.  also pushing things to hard to win causes problems. vasili is fired up by the mere appearance competition and nikita is bothered by the suffering animal 

vasili even enjoys winning a rigged race. 

above are theme enforcing justifications for the scene but what we’re really waiting for is an answer to the question: how does this scene advance the story in a non trivial way? 

returning to the idea of a story as a process for the transfer of energy. (creating storing and moving energy).


a writer makes energy in one beat and transfers it to the next one, preserving it.  She does this by knowing the nature / character of the energy she’s transferring. 



in a bad story or an easy draft, the writer doesn’t understand the nature of the energy she has made and ignores or misuses it. it dissipates. the preferred most efficient higher form of energy the premiere way for a scene to advance a story in a non trivial way is for a beat to cause the next beat.  Especially if that next beat is felt as essential i.e. as an escalation, meaningful alteration in the terms of a story. 

expecting to get lost again, we enter the beat we race a sled full of peasants.  What does the race cause to happen? well, it fires vasili up, of course it does.  this man who lives to win has won. This encounter cheered and enlivened vasili his elation then causes the next beat -> he drove on more boldly without examine the way marks urging on the horse and trusting to him which in turn causes the next essential non trivial beat: they get lost again. 



one of the most memorable things about this story is grieskena.  the little town that serves as a recurring indicator of how lost they are and represents their final final squandered chance of salvation. 

lets consider that clothesline that they pass four times.  Each time they describe it differently.  

first time: 

as they approach grieskana for the first time shirts one red and one white, trousers, leg bands and a petticoat fluttered wildly in the wind.  the white shirt in particular struggled desperately waving its sleeves about. 

second time: the way out of town: the white shirt has come lose from the line and is now attached only by one frozen sleeve. 

the 
juxaposition of these two images tells a little story.  as you entered this warm safe town I, this white shirt was frantic worried trying to signal to you that there was danger afoot. but you dopes ignored my advice and now are heading back into the storm and honestly all the energy has gone out of me and im just barely hanging on here.  that underscores our understanding of where we are, physically leaving town again; going out the way we came in and emotionally ignoring a warning due to our hubris 

then third time:

as they come back into griskana: the frozen wash still fluttered desperately in the wind.  we read this addition of still and desperately as yes, things continue to be desperate and vasili still doesn’t see it. Tolstoy doesn’t overdue it. two shirts are not, ya know, hugging one another in terror. but again, we take pleasure in the fact that he has remembered this laundry and has used it. 


fourth time: as they leave griskana for the second and last time. they drove again through the outskirts of the village past the yard where the frozen linen had hung which however was no longer to be seen. gulp. this last image is not the desperate waiting but a complete disappearance. It’s hard to say why this is so good. A clunky reading might be: its previous warnings having been ignored, the laundry has stopped signaling. 

or like that shirt somebody, vasili, is about to be gone. 

earlier we defined escalation as that which resolves when we refuse to repeat beats. each time we pass that clothesline, the laundry has undergone some small change in its condition.  We read this as an escalation or at least a mini escalation, a refusal to repeat. It would be a lesser story if all four descriptions were identical.  Always be escalating then can be understood as: be alert always to the possibilities you have created for variation.  if an element recurs, the second appearance is an opportunity for variation and potentially escalation.  

Lets say that in a film that we show a place setting, plates, spoons, fork, knife, and then the camera tracks across three other identical place settings, that’s static. but make the right adjustments to each of the four plate, spoon, fork knife arrangements, show these in sequence, and that more variation plus sequence will be felt to have escalation in it and therefore meaning.  For example lets say tgat as we track over the plates in sequence we see that: one cracked full arrangement plate spoon fork knife: two spoon missing; three: spoon and fork missing. four: all the silverware missing. only the plate remains. This will be felt to mean lets say evacuation or diminishment. Here, the pattern variation isn’t too neat or directly metaphorical. the clothes don’t for example go from unfrozen to frozen as nikita and vasili soon will but are frozen the first time we see them. We barely notice the variations of speed but on closer examination feel them to be perfectly pitched. Rather than neatly spitting out of some predetermined reductive meaning, they produce a feeling of mystery, the metaphorical world lightly infiltration the physical. After that race with the peasants and sled, fires vasili up,

rising action building to a climax.

we might wonder if it wants to be. 

there are many lovely things going on here: Nikita’s struggle not to drink. The funny bit in which Nikita responds


But none of this moves us out of the exposition 

As we saw with the darling: when we’re reading along

I find myself in this state as we approach the conversation while the horse is being harnassed. 

What happens during that conversation that might make it feel climatic.

The young people are getting out of hand. 

The family’s second son is thinking of dividing the household and this is breaking his father’s heart. 

ceaselessly perpetually what he wants to do. 

wormwood causes vasili to panic. Panicing, following the horse and even runs and soon finds himself back at the sled. Another case of fuedal circling. his terror is gone and if he felt any fear it was less the dreadful of terror should return.  The wormwood has scared the fear of death right out of him and replaced it with something worse the fear that he might again be overcome with fear.  What he’s afraid of suddenly is not death but fear and what he fears now is meaninglessness.  The meaninglessness he just glimpsed at the wyrmwood.  How do you keep meaninglessness at bay? that’s easy, he knows how to do that he knows.
