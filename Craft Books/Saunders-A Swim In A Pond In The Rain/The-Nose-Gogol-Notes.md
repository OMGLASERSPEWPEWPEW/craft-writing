The Nose - Nikolai Gogol (1836)

The door to the truth might be strangeness

consensus reality - the set of things about the world that we all agree to be pretty much true: water is blue, birds sing, etc.

singing birds were skimming low over expansive blue water

realism exploits our fondness for consensus reality limited to what’s physically possible but a story can also be truthful if it declines consensus reality if things happen in it that don’t and could never happen in the real world. If I assign you to write a story in which the characters are a cell phone, a pair of gloves and a falling leaf chatting away in a wheel barrel in a suburban driveway. Could that story be truthful? Yes.  It could be truthful in the way it reacts and responds to its premise, in the way it proceeds, by how things change in it, the contours of its internal logic, the relationships  


With sufficient care, that wheel barrel and the things it contains can become an entire system of meaning saying truthful things about our world.  Some of which might have been impossible from a more conventionally realistic approach. That system would mean not by the plausibility or acuity of its initial premise but by the way it reacts to that premise, by what it does with it. If a writer introduces a strange event then lets the fictive world respond to that event what we’re really learning is what we might call the fictive world’s psychological physics. 

What are the rules there? how do things proceed? a story like that will feel truthful and essential to the extent that the psychological physics of the fictive world are felt to be similar to the psychological physics of our own.  

Which brings us to El Nose

Ivan finds a nose in his morning load of bread. 

	‘Solid’ he exclaims in our translation, ‘Firm’ in another translation (translator names to come).

He’s dumbfounded as we would be. 

The nose in the bread is the initial strange event.  Now we wait to see how the fictive world, in this case
