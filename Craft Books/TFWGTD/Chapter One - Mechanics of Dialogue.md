Dialogue Tags and When to Use Them:

It takes about a second to read, “she said,” but that second checks the flow of the exchange, creating a minute pause. The reader hardly notices, but the pause is there.  This can be a consideration when the dialogue is anxious or heated and your two characters are pressing each other. Do you want to touch the brake at all? Maybe not.  The young man called Milkman, the protagonist of Toni Morrison’s rite-of-passage novel, Song of Solomon, is sitting in a barroom booth across from his friend, Guitar. Guitar asks Milkman why he has summoned him here, and Milkman says that he has just knocked his father down: 

“Hit him. Knocked him into the fuckin radiator.”
“What’d he do to you?”
“Nothin.”
“Nothin? You just upped and popped him?”
“Yeah.”
“For no reason?”
“He hit my mother.”
“Oh.”
“He hit her. I hit him.”
“That’s tough.”
“Yeah.”
“I mean it.”
“I know.”

Guitar is having trouble believing what Milkman has told him, and his incredulity gives his questions an inquisitorial edge.  Milkman is himself surprised by what he’s done, but his father had transgressed, and Milkman isn’t going to downplay hitting him, or apologize for it. Guitar is pressing Milkman and Milkman is pressing back, and Morrison dispenses with dialogue tags, letting the lines leap back and forth across the table, as fast as we can read them.

William Kennnedy’s Ironweed. 

The homeless protagonist, Francis Phelan, is walking down a street in Albany with his zany pal, Rudy:

“There’s seven deadly sins,” Rudy said.
“Deadly? What do you mean deadly?” Francis said.
“I mean daily,” Rudy said. “Every day.”
“There’s only one sin as far as I’m concerned,” Francis said.
“There’s prejudice.”
“Oh yeah. Prejudice. Yes.”
“There’s envy.”
“Envy. Yeah, yup. That’s one.”
“There’s lust.”
“Lust, right. Always liked that one.”
“Cowardice.”
“Who’s a coward?”
“Cowardice.”
“I don’t know what you mean.  That word I don’t know.”
“Cowardice,” Rudy said.
“I don’t like the coward word.  What’re you sayin’ about coward?”
“A coward. He’ll cower up. You know what a coward is? He’ll run.”
“No, that word I don’t know. Francis is no coward. Listen, you know what I like?”
“What do you like?”
“Honesty,” Francis said.
“That’s another one,” Rudy said. 

Kennedy tags the first four speeches, slowing the dialogue, keeping it tentative as the two men feel their way into the conversation.  Then, as they warm to the subject, dialogue tags all but disappear. There isn’t quite the intensity of emotion here that sharpens the exchange between Guitar and Milkman in the bar—this is a philosophical discussion—but it isn’t light or casual, either, and the absence of dialogue tags sustains both the prickliness on Francis’s side and Rudy’s haste to explain what he means and mollify him.  The final two lines are tagged: Kennedy touches the brakes as the conversation winds down, concluding on a genial note. 

I often advise students to read their dialogue tags aloud to themselves. There’s no better way to assess your dialogue tags than to hear them.  Are they buttressing the dialogue, or tripping it up? The morning after the Grangerford family takes him in, Huckleberry Finn wakes up and realizes he’s forgotten what he told them his name is:

So I laid there about an hour trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says: 

“Can you spell, Buck?”
“Yes,” he says.
“I bet you can’t spell my name,” says I.
“I bet you what you dare I can,” says he.
“All right,” says I, “go ahead.”
“G-e-o-r-g-e-J-a-x-o-n-there now,” he says.
“Well,” says I, “you done it, but I didn’t think you could.”

Days, but not many pages later, Huck sees Buck shoot at Harney Shepherdson from behind a bush, and wants to know why. Same characters, same voices, but the tempo now is very different:

“Did you want to kill him, Buck?”
“Well, I bet I did.”
“What did he do to you?”
“Him? He never done nothing to me.”
“Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?”
“Why, nothing—only it’s on account of the feud.”
“What’s a feud?”
‘Why, where was you raised? Don’t you know what a feud is?”
“Never heard of it before—tell me about it.”

Every line of speech is tagged in the first scene. The scene is comic, and it unfolds in an almost leisurely way.  Twain keeps the brakes on the dialogue, giving us time to enjoy it. There are no dialogue tags in the second colloquy: Buck’s blood is up, and Huck wants answers. Sometimes dialogue tags are of minor importance—the dialogue would work almost equally well with or without them—and sometimes they make all the differences. 






The Wisdom of Elmore Leonard and the Talking Verbs

The third of Elmore Leonard’s “Ten Rules of Writing,” which were published in a primer-sized leather-bound booklet and are available online, is a blanket prohibition: “Never use a verb other than ‘said’ to carry dialogue.”

I run into some resistance to this commandment when I’m teaching, and there are some great modern writers—Eudora Welty, notably—who decline to subscribe to it. 

“The line of dialogue belongs to the character,” Leonard explains. “The verb is the writer sticking his nose in. But ‘said’ is far less intrusive than grumbled, gasped, cautioned, lied.”

[I disagree. He just used explains. Explains is stronger and more active than said and there’s often time a contextual difference that isn’t conveyed by the dialog itself and also does provide a contextual bridge to the following dialog tag. I don’t know if that’s correct but that’s my thinking.]

I’d go further: “said” isn’t intrusive, at all. It’s invisible. The reader reads it again and again and again, and never notices it. The dialogue, then, stands on its own. This forces you, the writer, to write dialogue that needs no help, and dialogue that needs no help is good dialogue. 

I don’t know what Leonard would have said about “asked” and “answered.” Most writers use them, but an answer is obviously an answer, so why not stick with “said”? I’m not a stickler about “asked”—I may have used it myself a few times—but the question mark at the end of the line makes the verb redundant. 

I do know what Leonard would have said about “continued” and “interrupted”—he never use them. “Continued” is a lumbering verb that treats the reader like … well, isn’t it obvious that the speaker is continuing? Likewise, an interruption is an interruption and doesn’t need to be identified as one. Beginners love the verb for some reason, and again and again I find myself pointing out that the line they’ve written isn’t even an interruption—the previous line is a complete sentence. 

	From Ironweed:

	“If I come back tomorrow…”
	“We’ll see about tomorrow,” said the preacher, who grabbed the doorknob himself and pulled it to as he ushered Little Red out into the night.”

	The preacher stops Little Red in mid-sentence, speaking over him and hurrying him out the door. Who needs to be told that the preacher “interrupted” Little Red?

Avoid adverbs to Modify “Said”

Italics in Dialogue
Italicized words are emphatic, sometimes loud, sometimes shrill, and permissible in limited amounts. 

Higgins never italicizes dialogue in The Friends of Eddie Coyle. He never has to. Here, Jackie Brown, the gun dealer, finds himself under arrest:

	“Do you understand your rights?” Moran said.
	“Yes,” Jackie Brown said. “Yes, yes, yes.”
	“Shut up,” Moran said. “Turn around and hold out your wrists.”
	Foley snapped the handcuffs on Jackie Brown’s wrists. “You’re under arrest for violation of the U.S. Code twenty-six, Section fifty-eight-sixty-one, possession of a machine gun without being registered as the owner and possessor of a machine gun.”
	“Hey,” Jackie Brown said. 
	“Shut up,” Foley said. “I don’t want to hear one more fucking word out of you. You keep your goddamned trap shut. Now get in your car.”

	Read this aloud, and you can’t help raising your voice. Expletives usually raise the volume level; it’s hard to read them quietly.  Moran’s voice is under control when he recites the charge against Jackie Brown—the length of the lines, as well as the dry legal syntax, bring the level down—but the short lines are snappish. There’s voltage in them. They’re loud. The verb, you’ll notice, is always “said,” and it is never modified. 

Exclamation Points - Keep your exclamation points under control.  You are allowed no more than five or six per 100,000 words of prose. 

“If you have a knack of playing with exclaimers the way Tom Wolfe does, you can throw them in by the handful.” 

Wolfe certainly does. From A Man in Full:

	“This is so funny, because I was thinking about you just yesterday and wondering how to get in touch with you!”
	“With me?”
	“Yes! There’s something I need to run by you. Could I give you a ring?”
	“Well—of course, Mr…”
	“Peepgass!” he said. “Ray! Make it Ray!”
	He produced a ballpoint pen from an inside jacket pocket and then began ransacking his tuxedo for a piece of paper. Finding none, he thrust out the cuff of the sleeve of his shirt and positioned the pen above it and grinned and said, “What’s the number?”
	“Not on your shirt! It’ll never come out.”
	“You’re right! Here—I’ll put it here!” He positioned the pen over the back of his left hand and grinned some more. 


Alternative:

	“Not on your shirt. It’ll never come out.”
	“You’re right. Here—I’ll put it here.”
	
Martha’s voice jumps an octave with the italicized shirt, and Peepgass’s line comes tumbling out of him, rapid and jumpy, even without the exclamation point. 


There is also the option of ratcheting up the said verb into a shout, a yell, a holler, a cry. 

These verbs make an exclamation point unnecessary, but they also accommodate it, when it is there.
