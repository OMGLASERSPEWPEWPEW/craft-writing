***"Hey, Itchy!"


***

	The shout leaps from Athey’s throat and into the cavernous undercroft before she can stop it. For a terrifying, fleeting breath, the eleven-foot giant keeps walking, a hulk of muscle in a colorless world of blacks, grays, and high white skylights. What if Itchy doesn’t stop? The thought hangs in Athey’s mind as tears begin to well. Then he does. He perks up and he turns. He sees Athey and at once his eyes widen, his broken, brutish, beautiful features split into a grin. He flips his monocle up, approaches, arms out wide. “Holy hell, Athee in the flesh."
	When Itch gets close, skylight warmth vanishes, skin cools. Athey's well aware of her goofy grin as she cranes her neck up to him. 
	His face is an eclipse and she can’t help it, stain glass windows bloom and wreathe his head: last five matches on his left and the screen pair of his last match yesterday and his next match this afternoon. The central screens adorning his forehead each loop with unwatched videos of his little ogiers in various forms of play.   Each pang of guilt is a shade different for depending on the child, the missed bought, the missed color and missed errant remark. Don’t spoil it. Athey glances at the feed for his upcoming match and the last. “Don’t tell me they got you playing tonight.  How's the shoulder?"
	“Terrific." 
	Athey doesn’t know the opposing team’s guardian but the stats say he’s a real bruiser, young too. She throws a playful hook hard into his thigh. It’s like punching a boulder except this time her metacarpals wince. Athey fans her hands, full of joy, unfazed. “Aw, man! I'm sorry.”
	“It is what it is. Good to see you. Here to see Luft?” 

[action tag affecting Athey? A cage train of tigers she steps away from and closer to Itch]


—11122025 STOP 
	“

What’s been going on with you? How many seasons has it been since we played a game together?”


	“No time for games anymore.”
	“It’s all a game, Athey.”
	“Not for me.” Athey tugs Itchy's finger, her hand barely circles the scarred, calloused thickness of his thumb, smiles. ”You talk to Luft?”
	"Nah. What a hit though, damn. I love seeing him play prime. What a treat for us normies, right?”
	“Reminds me of him in '23”
	“Oh, yeah! Tower in the first fifteen." He laughs. "Remember those raptors falling over themselves, running—” 
	“Hey, Itch, sorry, I’m in a rush. I’ve got to see Luft.”
	Itch’s smile flattens, then softens. “Yeah, I understand. But make time, some time. Water Day will always be closing in.” 
	He’s not wrong. She's living it and then some; Itch doesn't see it. She’ll make Water Day for her stack another year and she only had to sell out an old friend this time. Athey might let herself think that it means things are getting better, but her girlfriend has either left her, or is missing, just like Memphis—the woman who raised her. As Memphis would say, she’s spinning too many stakes. 
	“Okay, Itch. How bout next Friday?”
	Itch nods, backing away, turns. Sky-lit concrete dust swirls as his massive silhouette cuts through it. He rounds the concourse corner and vanishes.  
	Athey takes a deep breath of air rank with diesel, sweat, and worse. It’s good to be back. *Itch is right, I should play more. I should make time.* But when? That’s an entirely different story. The thought alone makes the three problems she was avoiding appear out of thin air and press in on her like walls. She wasn’t giving up; she was just trying to clear her head, but emotions have a way of catching up. 
	As if on cue, three ghostly gray outlines of screen clusters coalesce before her. One directly ahead and one flanking each side. They float stationary as she walks, persistent landmarks foreshadowing a lively coliseum’s undercroft, her three chief problems: Water Day for her stack, The Ten Twenty-Four; her missing girlfriend, Dina on her left, who may have just left her; and the woman who had raised her, Memphis on the right, who is most definitely missing. Three things she can’t change at this moment yet they make her visual periphery flutter—a warning purple for her spiking heart rate, an urgent red for her rising temperature. Signals from her body, and something else, telling her to slow down.
	

	Athey exhales.
	One black, iron-buckled, high-top in front of the other. 
	These visual cues were sent from nerves that weren’t entirely hers, and not completely biological. The system grew from an AI seeded in a synthetic sheath, implanted at the base of her skull when she was a child. It was one of the last great things Homo sapiens would ever make, as much a work of art as a feat of tech and technique.	The Japanese company had named it the Kokorotama®.
	She wasn’t giving up; she was just taking a break.
	Her three problems dissolve to a translucent presence as she exerts her force of will to draw reins on the small warm ball at the base of her neck. The light warmth blooms up and around her skull in the form of thousands of tiny subtle tendrils that crawl all the way to the front of her face and apex at a point above and between her eyes. Colorful info screens blink in and out, rising, falling like starling wings. The murmuration drifts with her eyes, encircling what they land on: the black-and-white arena sign, ‘P-15,’ and the info screens of occupancy, game stats on Wish’s raza team, ‘Havoc.’
	Athey’s gaze crosses the undercroft ceiling to land on the neon sign flashing on the other side: Johnny’s #1 Italian Bug-Beef Sandwiches with an AR screen displaying their newest sauce, tequila blue ranch. 
	“Maybe on the way out.”
	Athey’s gaze falls and rests on an older woman; her identity fills in beside her along with the man in tradesman overalls she flirts with. Circles around the raised eyebrow, lines drawn from the corner of smiles and Koko’s five-word summary, her situational read, marquees above both: Lonely woman encounters possible lover.	
	Athey smiles and looks away, resting on a cage train of skin-and-bone tigers. Their bulk snakes through two larger-than-life holos, breaking them into static as if parting grass. The holos reform, resuming their loops.
	Kera first—stuttering gray light, perfect posture behind a spotless kitchen counter, crisp black-and-white checkered apron. She churns cake batter with a wooden spoon, making the same rotation it makes for the billionth time. Pearly whites gleam and gleam again. Her marquee reads: Sub Now: Gingerbread Cookies. A Happy Home Means A Happy You. 
	Then Afra materializes next: light jeans, cowgirl boots, cowgirl hat. Kneeling low, hips rolling in endless waves, a wink at every crest, marquee reading: Sub Now: Cowgirl Afra. Chicagoland’s Number One Rodeo Rider.  Her motion accompanied by her sultry disembodied voice that echoes across the undercroft: Someone’s got to appreciate a good cowgirl around these parts. 
	Is That You? Afra’s voice echoes across the undercroft. The sign, ‘P-16’ comes into view. 
	Athey scoffs under her breath, unable to parse the culprit for the bile she tastes in her mouth.  Is it the performative labor? Or the digital alienation that comes from the display of an ideal kept perpetually out of reach. The thought holds strong in Athey’s mind for a step before it crumbles under the truth: When Dina took the dancer’s gig for Kera and Afra’s royal party, she did it on the other side of an ultimatum Athey wishes she could take back. Now Dina’s gone and Athey doesn’t know if she’s dead or just not coming back.
	Again her world flutters violet-red, but avoidance isn’t the only way to deal with conflict. If she doesn’t fix something soon, she’s going to drown. The memory flashes in: Late night in the real world, dark night in the virtual game world of Eternals: Monster Slayers®, MomMemphis quarterbacking her through a vampire’s cathedral. Athey, focus on one mob at a time—you always juggle too many stakes. So, Athey’s lip purses and she gets back to work. 
	Against the black-grey-white world, those translucent landmarks color in vibrantly, and lively data begins to scroll as if rendered visible through moonlight magic. Ahead is the TenTwentyFour’s financial reality, a problem solved for the time being at the cost of an old friend. Leave Wish behind or waste a hundred of hers waste away drinking the lake or rain. What’s worse? 
	Right is the last pass of satellite over Thailand. A red trail superimposes itself over the terrain, Memphis’ travel over the past week. 

NEXT PASS T-MINUS: -02:43:37

	Left is Dina’s last known location, caught by drone camera, a bird’s eye view of Dina entering Club Stix and a silent loop of their crash out hours before and why she’s here. 
	‘P-17’ comes into view. 
	She’s already convinced Luft to betray Wish and now she’s here to convince him to do one more thing that he’d rather not: Athey needs to convince him to go to Club Stix and help Athey find his sister. 
	Athey grimaces, thinks to a militant memory of Memphis. Summer space camp deep in the Amazon. Her voice stern, ‘Life is one big churn of problems, fix what you can when you can and never stop. That’s the only way to float.’
	Athey about-faces and heads down the hallway to P-17.





 

	















	The hallway stretches ahead. Half the lights are out, the other half flicker. Every flicker pulls the memory closer. This hallway, wide enough for three, had felt cramped then. Athey looks down. Black jean shorts. Black fishnets. Black buckle high tops. Small. But with the next flicker she sees different legs from past days—hex-scale vanta black wrapping from boot heel to hip like a second skin. She'd towered over Luft then, moved those augmented legs like they were born hers. She blinks. Gone. Just her own legs carrying her forward. The memory of what she'd cost him. P-17's door looms ahead. She turns the handle.
	A haze of light leaks from the high ceiling, lining the hallway like a faint trail toward the pen’s center.  She sets her palm to the coarse, cracking concrete and steps forward.  [stakes + shame] Painted palm prints spot the hallway.  Higher up, ogier palm prints crowd like a canopy she can’t reach. She goes from print to print, pausing at the smaller ones she left years ago, tracing her way toward the pen’s center where gray-padded pillars, and T.E.I.X.’s arms and rigging, break her sightlines and form a cage inside the room’s cross.  The whisper of T.E.I.X.’s whirring comes within earshot, along with soft gasps of releasing air.
 	Athey stops at the edge where concrete gives way to foam matting.  	[motivation/intention: needs Luft to search for Dina]
She slips off her black buckle high-tops and sets them on the concrete edge.  The mat squeaks and squishes under her feet as she angles past a post, catching Luft in fragments— a flash of a bruised rib, a wet delta of blood running down his side. As she clears the last pillar where the rig opens, she sees the crater at his collarbone. His face is hidden behind a black plastic shrubbery of screens and displays. He stands in the pit, bare-chested, blood bright, colors dancing across his skin.
	Athey lifts her shades and rests the glasses on her inverted braid—color floods in. Bright yellow washes from the kitchen nook on her left, cold green spills from the edges of the giant door marked ‘WC’ on her right, and orange leaks from the lamps high above. For beat, Athey’s lost in the lively colors dancing on Luft.
	[motivation - hates using him but she’s got no other way]
	‘Welcome, Athey,’ Tesh says. Its arms lift the screens away from Luft as if removing a crown.




Her mouth goes dry. Fix what you can, when you can, Memphis said. Her prints are the promise. Luft is the cost. Three days to Water Day. No one’s giving.

To get Luft to go where she can’t and convince him, beg him, to search for his sister.

	Bad luck is no excuse for bad choices



	Tesh beeps twice again: "Connection request: Wish.”
	Luft: you didn’t have to say that. I don’t hold anything against you Wish
	Wish: I know, Luft, that’s the problem.  We played our best as a team and it wasn’t enough as a team.  You were incredible, we all were. It just wasn’t enough, we weren’t enough.

	Luft you were up against Tan. Your hands were full.

“Boy, Damn,. This day’s full of surprises.”


“Hey Luft!” Athey says, kicking off her black buckle high tops. The high tops are within hand as her butt drops to the pit’s edge and slides off, her feet dropping on the cushy mat as if she dipped into a pool. She slips her high tops in a cubby for human shoes and freezes in place as she catches a whiff in the air, grime and filth of a particular cigar with masked as if there were a polite way to pollute.

Itchy eclipses Athey as he nears his dark brown eyes —beading eyes, scintilla, stars, distance, somehow look small under the jut of his brow???—

His eyes grow darker looking down at her as if from over a cliff. 

Athey with a palm squeezes Itchy’s gigantic finger. 
“Talk to Luft?”
“Nah. What a hit though.” Itchy nods proudly. “Luft’s playing to win today. God damn what a treat.”

Athey tenses an eye lid, just slightly, imperceptibly by most, colored windows of charts and news alight themselves about Itchy’s head, a neon laurel of news and data on Itchy.  something something sun draped. 



	“Hey Itch.  You’re going up against bruno tonight.  You remember he likes playing at heights, right?”
	“Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  Thanks, Athey.”
	Athey squeezes again before walking on “Be careful!”
	“Man, I dunno. Seeing Luft play like that makes me want to take a hole to the shoulder today.

Wish.  I once caught the public’s curiosity with the notion that I’ve never made a wish.  It’s why I never felt close to my audience because I knew that what they loved was my lie.  Since I can remember, I have wished a single thing: that I could take this suit out of this arena and fight sting the powers painfully not matter how pitiful so that that great hand of power moves away and gives my people space.

Star Blue:
Doing wrong takes just as much work as righting things. It’s true you don’t half to do anything, that nature will correct itself, but it’s only true because not all of nature is blind to the virtue of doing something.
