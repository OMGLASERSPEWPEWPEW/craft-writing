    Sweat pools in Luft's mask, stinging the cut above his brow. Sun spears through the blown-out upper deck on the arena’s southwest side, a twenty-story hole of twisted rebar and concrete from the war before his time. He hooks two fingers under the pauldron's edge and lifts, metal scrapes against metal, polyurethane pulls away from his flesh. 
	Gotta let the pain breathe, son. Dad's voice. Right there in the space between his shoulder and the steel. Luft can't help but smile at the bloodied hollow beneath his collarbone. That right there's some good blood. He coughs iron and wipes the smile away: he’s moving this game for money—hurting someone he likes in the process. How many friends will today leave him?
	Weak. 
	A muffled explosion thumps from the pine forest about a hundred and fifty yards downfield. A crackle splits his ear, Bang's voice: "Holy hell. Luft. Who knew you could still play like that?” 
	Luft heads toward his team’s base. A severed arm sprawls ahead near the lane’s edge, one part of a blood-and-guts tableau, technically a novelty, but familiar enough to drag him back to his last game with Wish. The memory hits: a gentle pat from her Valkyrie® remote. Through the white-pink chassis of the twelve-foot mech, the force rippled into his armor. They were down at the half. His fault. Her wispy voice cheered in his earpiece: “Don’t worry, Luft. We can do this. We always do."	Luft boots the arm past the tree line. Today feels worse than he'd expected.
	He'd promised Wish he'd bring her team a win; her crew needed it for their Water Day allocation. And when he said, ‘Sure,’ he’d meant it. But that was before Athey ran the numbers, offering odds on the other side that were too good to pass up. The plan was simple: crush the Star Hawks in the first half, then throw the second. Algos love a comeback—they eat that shit up.
	Bang comms through Luft’s earpiece: “Luft?”
	“Just getting lucky, boss."		
	“Lucky,” Bang replies. The left-side pine forest muffles another explosion. “My ass. I watched you play as a kid. You still got it. Holy hell.”
	Luft trudges over the base line, past the humming crystal. The team’s twenty pens arc ahead, a glinting junkyard steel crescent. Above the stands, the betting boards sit dark, waiting. Five minutes until the new parlays drop.
	Bang’s grainy voice in Luft’s ear: “Wish was cagey in signing, but I had a feeling she’d pull you in. And now, hot damn. I’m playing with the greatest has-been that ever was. Tell you what—you play another game for me, I keep old Wish around for another season.”
	Luft spits. There are two flavors of pajama pilots: those with heart and heartless fucks like Bang. Fucking him over would be the one bright spot in this shit-sandwich Tuesday. 
	“Give it a think, Luft.”
	“Yeah, sure, boss.”
	A horn blares. Three hundred feet up over the arena center, the scoreboard flares the ten-second warning. Red digits count down the half’s last seconds.
	RIP cuts through the channel, razor-sharp: "Did you see that? DID YOU SEE THAT!?”
	Static pops as Bang's clipped chuckle and Wish's breathy giggle cut through the channel.	
	"Oh my gosh, RIP!" Wish’s words tumble over the static, bright and feather-light. "We actually did it. The Star Hawks can't touch us now—”
	Bang cuts in, “Comms. Game’s not over yet, people. Back to your pens: refit and refuel. I want a team call in five.” 
	Luft pops the blood-slicked plastic of his earpiece free. With it out, he scans the colosseum bowl. 
	He feels as defeated in these last twenty yards as he did three years ago with Wish and the rest—Athey, Dot, Powda. Back then, this stadium, built to hold a half-million, was half-full. Fans roared and talent scouts' binoculars winked through the heat-haze of the upper deck. Wish's voice had carried that same bright hope, making miracle plays while Luft gave up the middle lane, costing them the championship, costing them their shot. 
	They never blamed him, not once, though he failed them all. 
	Now a lone drunk sleeps in the highest row; a thousand scattered fans slouch below. Exactly what he deserves.
	Weak.
	With one gauntleted hand, he lifts his oni menpō mask, just enough to keep his face hidden from the gamblers. With the other, he pops a SediChew.
	The gamblers—the only souls willing to endure this blistering sun for a mid-season snoozer—pack the stands above P-17. A mosaic of faded jerseys lines the rail thirty feet above him: Hawks, Banditos, Iron Dogs. They have long abandoned the fandom, all playing with the same desperate math, each hoping to get lucky enough to feed their families. One of them, a leering man in a Hawks shirt, leans right over the center seat between the mastodon horns—the spot where Dad used to cheer.
	BAM—BAM—BAM. Luft hammers the door with his gauntlet. Made of heavy welded truck bones, P-17's door groans and shudders upward.
	"You fucking smurfs!" The gambler's voice cracks with fury. "Ruining everything!" He crumples his betting slip, snarling. "We got families, you piece of gene-spliced freak.” 
	The balled slip missiles toward Luft's mask, bouncing off his pauldron. A dozen more follow from the other gamblers. 
	The lead gambler leans over the rail, teeth bared. He opens his hand, revealing a plastic cup. For a moment it lords over Luft too, then plummets. 
	Luft's jaw clenches behind his mask, but he doesn't move. 
	A memory flashes: Practice night with Dad, his weathered grip steers Luft's jaw toward the lightless Chicagoland sky, a thinly clouded full moon. Luft breathes in the endless stars, exhales the midnight winter. Dad's voice, steady in his cold quiet:  “Let them boo. You don’t owe them shit. Sides, them hating you is better: hatred blinds, makes people bet bad. Playing them is better than playing the game. That’s where you earn the real pay.” 
	Beer splashes over Luft’s left pauldron, drenching him in the rank funk of sweet-sick, piss-warm hops.
	The clock drones down. Four. Three. Two. One. 
	The gambler props himself on the rail, knuckles white on the mastodon horns, but he’s the one who looks away first.
	Luft ducks under the metal-moan of P-17’s door. 
	The announcer’s voice rings through the door’s closing grind: “Get your three-for-one Johnny’s #1 Italian Bug-Beef Sandwiches! Hell, get two for a free beer—” 
	Metal slams concrete, leaving only the peace of idle whirring and the dim light of orange ceiling lamps that wash his dull chrome armor amber. P-17 is built like most other pens: one long corridor connects the field to the colosseum’s undercroft. Another corridor cuts across it, a kitchen nook on the left and a toilet on the right. Foam padding wraps the floor and four concrete pillars at the pen's center. The pen's empty now. Luft prefers it crowded, like back after their quarter-final win—two ogres and three remotes squeezed shoulder to shoulder around the pillars. He'd felt invincible that night, even though he'd nearly died. Wish had saved him, a miracle. When he tried to thank her, she stopped him with a single finger and a remote kiss on the cheek. Her voice, a synth lullaby: “Don’t. You’d do the same for me.”
	The pen feels hollow now. 
	Between the pillars lies the pit, a metal enclosure under a canopy of dormant robot arms. Light from the high skylight slants down, glinting off rust and old paint, setting the dust motes adrift above the blood-stained grate. In the far corner, a graveyard of broken gear rises in a jagged pile. 
	Cigar smoke cuts through the pen’s metallic air, someone’s here. 
	He blind-tosses what’s left of his car-bone shield, laser-shorn in half, toward the corner. 
	His mom’s hologram shrieks a half-second before it sails through her, splitting her translucent green image at the waist as the butterflies on her kimono are torn apart by waves of static.
	The shield crashes against the wall and tumbles onto the pile. Her projection solidifies again. She hunches behind the largest shield fragment, her shoulders drawn up to her ears.
	Luft sighs. “How many times have I told you not to stand there, Ma?”
	The hologram says nothing, trembling behind the pile of broken bulwarks. Fear or failure. 
	Weak.
	A slow curl rises from beneath the frayed bill of Dad’s old Los Banditos ball cap. 
	Damn. 
	He’d played goofy, used his club offhand. Scored no points by the book. A perfect, invisible smurf. But hiding from a parent was a different game. They saw the breath you took before a lunge because it’s what they taught you.	Luft’s eyes flick to the dark screens above the pen. The second-half parlays would drop in two minutes. Dad’s here to ask him to do what he was already doing—lose—but to a script that’s most profitable to those dad owes. However, Luft's moves are taken; he's got his own script, a partner in crime—Athey.
	Dad sinks into the kitchen chair as if he owns the pen, the team, and the air Luft heaves to breathe. The man is six feet of dark leather and skinny limbs, a height Luft outgrew at nine. But the father in his mind is a giant, all voice and will—the man who coached his first point, first win, and first planned loss. The man who once told Luft he could make everyone happy so long as he wasn't weak.
	Ash drops from his cigar onto the pen’s concrete. He’s here to tell him to do what he’s already doing, screw Wish, but to the ends of those he owes. Shouldn’t that be validating or some shit? Why does it feel worse?
	Luft extends his arms wide, a familiar cross, and lumbers to the center of the pen. His boots scuff over the massive, abyssal grate. The machine posts of the rig surround him, a cage within a cage. Robot arms reach down from on high. Luft closes his eyes. 
	The bursts of whirring cut in and touch soft like cat paws.
	Luft's shoulders go slack. Dad's smoke, the wound, Mom, Wish—all of it fades behind the low ebb of muffled pneumatic hisses and their soft whirring touches of the T.E.I.X.®. 
	Drills latch onto his armor and release. 
	The heavy bridle of steel pauldrons lifts away from his shoulders. Air floods him; the weight lifts. Blood runs from the baseball-sized crater straight through his collarbone. For the first time since entering the pen, his jaw unclenches.	
	T.E.I.X. speaks, her voice disembodied and dispassionate. “Health status: Punctures of the left lung, sixth and seventh lobes. Prognosis: manageable.”
	“Yeah, thanks, Tesh.” His split lip widens with each word. Blood drips through the grate’s dark spaces. Maybe he’s getting ahead of himself.  Dad’s known and coached Wish almost as long as Athey. Luft rolls his neck, pops three vertebrae, and straightens. A last bolt falls and his first chest plate releases. “See Wish? Prime day for her.”
	Dad grunts, takes a slow drag from his cigar and gestures with his chin toward Mom’s cowering holo, “Why you got her like that?”
	“Got her like what?”
	“Like this.” Dad hops off the chair, feet thudding lightly on the foam mat. He skirts left around rig to Mom’s holo, crouched behind a hill of shields in the corner. Her head ghosts above the rims—eyes blown wide, heavy holo breathing. The instant her gaze hits Luft, she startles like a deer in tall grass, phases back through the stack.
	“You’re not even real,” Dad yells. “Stupid AI bitch.”
	Mom flickers upright, a foot shorter than Dad, barely reaching Luft's waist. “お願いします! 放してください!”
	Dad raises a wrench, brandishing it over her. Her shoulders hitch; the projection stutters—then steadies. She plants her feet, drops her fists, lifts her chin, and meets his eyes.
	“お願い、やめて!”
	Luft's brow furrows. He mouths the sounds under his breath, 'Oh-neh-guy... ya-me?' The syllables feel clumsy on his tongue and the rest escapes him. His chest swells as the second chest plate unmoors and tumbles to the mat with a thud. Blood runs from the hole in his collarbone, but it’s the hollow in his chest that hurts Luft worse, the knowledge that it’s better that she wasn’t really here—“That’s how she’d be.”
	Dad crosses his arms and leans against a padded concrete pillar. “They showed me a vid of her talking Japanese. Talked real nice. Could tell she was sweet. This ain’t how she has to be.”
	Tesh sticks Luft with a needle. 
	Luft winces. “Why you here?”
	“Wanted to see you,” Dad says.
	Luft grunts. 
	Tesh chimes three times: “Thirty seconds until second-half parlays.”
	Dad’s neck cranes toward the dark betting board. 
	“Today’s gonna be interesting.” Dad’s smile doesn’t reach his eyes. “Who could’ve known Wish’d be sober for once?”
	“Wish ain’t an addict.” Luft voice hardens. “She just had no possibilities.” 
	A separate collection of ceiling monitors start flipping their displays, Bang’s machinations: field maps with neon-color routes. Other displays fill up with tactics and strategies. Nothing surprising, nothing useful. Luft had won this with Wish, and he would lose it alone.
	“Look, I’m happy for the girl, especially with what she’s been through.” Dad sprinkles more ash on the mat. “But when you beat expectations by that much, it only  guarantees a bigger win on the other side. AI likes awarding winners but it loves hammering down nails even more.”
	“I think there’ll be some good lines to hit on the other side too—things we can land with how Wish is playing.”
	Dad smacks Tesh with a wrench, halting all arms of the machine tree at once. The rig vibrates, whines. “Think!? I ain’t spent a dollar for a gene that makes you think better, boy. How can you still be thinking about winning?”
	Luft steadies Tesh with a gentle hand. “Wish deserves a win.”
	Tesh chimes twice: “Twenty seconds until second-half parlays.”
	“Luft! You’re seventeen. You’re life in terms of potential is over.”
	Luft pops a SediChew, giving Bang’s mediocre plays a second look. “I can win this.”
	“For what?” Dad massages his bald spot, spilling new ash on a different part of the mat. “Luft, you’ve got two, maybe three years left. It’s time you started thinking about making what you can, while you can.”
	“I can do that without screwing Wish. I’ll just make a little less.”
	Tesh chimes once: “Ten seconds until second-half parlays.”
	“Don’t think of it like you’re screwing Wish. Think of it like,” Dad fans a hand in the air, “Think of it like: Wish is just screwed and that’s the way it is. If it’s wrong, why would they allow it?”
	The second-round parlays light up a cluster of screens. Several high green parlays show payouts for Wish’s team to pull off wins in particular ways. And, an equal amount of parlays in red detailing some interesting ways for the other team to win. Predictably, the red payouts are higher. Luft spots the parlay Athey will want, a blend of payout and sanity. Dad’ll want the one with the highest payout, the hardest.
	“See Luft—” 
	Tesh beeps twice, then speaks: "Connection request: Bang.”
	Luft lifts a palm to Dad. “Tell Bang I need a few. Thanks, Tesh”
	Sparks shower Luft as Tesh’s meticulous arms patch the hole in Luft’s pauldron and other various armor pieces. 
	“—, but reality agrees with me." Dad puts on his worn AI glasses, his fingers flicking quickly as he places bets while payouts are highest.
	Luft needs air. He slams the wide door button near his head. 
	The service-area door swings inward. Under-arena concourse sounds spill in: a forklift diesel growl.  The crash and scrape of crates. Then, someone’s raspy shout—it’s Athey.

"Hey, Itchy!"
